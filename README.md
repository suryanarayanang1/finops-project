FinOps Dashboard for Cloud Cost Visibility (Simulated)

This project simulates a cloud cost monitoring dashboard using Python and SQLite. It demonstrates key FinOps concepts by generating fake cloud billing data, storing it locally, analyzing it, and visualizing daily spending trends.

Objective

Build a local dashboard to:
- Track and store daily cloud cost data (simulated)
- Analyze trends such as total cost, average daily cost, and most expensive day
- Break down cost per service
- Visualize trends with `matplotlib`
